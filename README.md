This is a hospitalised system which we have created. Here we have got various tabs/pages such as homepage, login pages and gallery.

Homepage - This is where we you get an overview of what our website is and what service we provide
gallery - in gallery page we have various images
login - In the login page, either the admin, doctor or patient can login and can see the information which they have access to. For example doctor will be able to see details of the patient and the patient will be able to see what upcoming appointments they have. Every person is given access according to their needs so the security is exellent
