# Life-Care-Hospital

This is a hospitalised system which we have created. Here we have got various tabs/pages such as homepage, login pages and gallery.

Homepage - This is where we you get an overview of what our website is and what service we provide
gallery - in gallery page we have various images
login - In the login page, either the admin, doctor or patient can login and can see the information which they have access to. For example doctor will be able to see details of the patient and the patient will be able to see what upcoming appointments they have. Every person is given access according to their needs so the security is exellent 

-	Our programming language is based in html, css, javascript and php for our website. For our DBMS we have used XAMP.
-	PHP is used for the connection with XAMP so that we can access all the data from our database. We have used visual studio code and bootstrap as a platform for coding. 
-	We have used HTML as a basis of structure for our website. This is used to write the content. CSS is used for styling in the website such a size of text, where to place the image, etc. Javascript is used for form validation such as if the field is asking to input a number and you enter a text, then it’s not going to accept is. JS is used on our website when logging in. for example when if the field is asking for email and you don’t enter @ or you enter a number it will throw an error. Bootstrap has all these HTML, Javascript and CSS included in it. 
-	PHP has a major role in the security of our website. For example in our website, it playing a major role in the case of login and registration of the admin, doctor and patient. Lets say if the doctor wants to login and he enters his details, the PHP first check this details with the database. If the information is correct, php redirects it to the doctors dashboard. If not, it shows an error message saying incorrect username or password.
